diode - C81598
fuse - no basic fuse (C70069) (Handsolderable)
crystal - Maybe C13738
10k ohm resistor - C17414
22 ohm resistor - C17561
5.1k ohm resistor - C27834
100nF capacitor - C49678
10 uF capacitor - C440198
1uF capacitor - C28323
22pF capacitor - C1804
Ferrite Bead (FB1) - no basic ferrite bead (C18305) (Handsolderable)
PRTR - no basic part (C12333) (Too expensive to buy individually, min 3000 for $284)
ATMEGA microcontroller - no basic part (UNLESS I IMPLEMENT THIS microcontroller C14877 the ATMEGA328P)
or this one STM32F103C8T6 (C8734)
(I'LL PROBABLY STICK WITH ATMEGA32U4)
Type-C Port - no basic part (C165948)
Reset Switch - Alternative that's slightly smaller (C318884)

SMT:
ATMEGA32U4
TYPE-C PORT

NEED TO FIND FERRITE BEAD AND PRTR
